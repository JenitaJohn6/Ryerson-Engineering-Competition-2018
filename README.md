automated driving and transportation. The Ministry expects 50% of cars on its roads to be
autonomously capable by 2021. Therefore the city is investing heavily into the automation of
Toronto’s mass transportation systems, and the development of AI compatible road networks
and related infrastructure in this transition phase.
